# Sylloge by Manu

A curated (and evolving) collection of university notes and study materials across multiple subjects.

This repository acts as a central index for both local notes and external repositories related to my academic work and personal study. It is meant to grow over time, reflecting different courses and topics.

> **Language note**: Most of the materials in this repository are written in Italian, as they are produced during my studies at an Italian university.

---

## 🧭 Scope
The materials collected here span different subjects and formats, including:
- lecture notes
- drafts and working notes
- study materials and references

This repository is **not intended to be a polished textbook**. Instead, it represents a structured and evolving collection of personal study resources, made public for anyone who may find them useful.

> **Note**: This material is **not intended to replace or substitute** the official material provided by course instructors.
